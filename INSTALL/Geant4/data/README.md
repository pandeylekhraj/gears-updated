[set.bat](set.bat) is a Windows [batch][] file used to download Geant4 data files and set corresponding environment variables automatically. Place it in a folder where you'd like to save Geant4 data files and double click it to run it. Without any modification, it works for the newest Geant4. If you need it to work with older versions of Geant4, please open it with a text editor and change the versions of datasets accordingly before running it.
